# üé¨ Movie Genre Predictor

## Project Description

This project implements a **Movie Genre Prediction** model that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify movies into genres based on their descriptions. By converting text data into numerical form and training a classifier, the model can predict a movie's genre using supervised learning techniques.

## üîç Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Uses `TfidfVectorizer` to transform movie descriptions into numerical feature vectors.
- **Model Training**: A `LogisticRegression` classifier is trained on these features to learn the relationship between text and genres.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is measured using accuracy on a held-out test set.
